Following sourcecodes in cs50 class &amp; memo
I learned that variables in functions are stored from the end of memory a.k.a "stack". 
If I want to swap variables in main function by using a customized function, I need to use pointer, not just swapping 'copied new variables'.

Notifying this sourcecode is provided by CS50 lecture. (Especially, I took a lecture on https://www.boostcourse.org/cs112/joinLectures/41489 )
